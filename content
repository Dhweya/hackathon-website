  How much does it cost?
Nothing at all! Registration and participation are completely free. Moreover, you’ll be rewarded with unique prizes just for participation and even if you end up potentially winning categories. 

	Is there an age restriction? 
Not an official one, however, we do recommend being at least 12 years old for basic knowledge and familiarity. 

	How much experience do I need? 
We welcome everyone and anyone! Whether you are a beginner and it’s your first competing or are an experienced hackathon/makerthon participant, we invite all skill levels. 

	Do I need a team? 
Not really! It’s great if you do, but don’t worry if you don’t. You will have the chance to meet fellow participants and make teams of up to 4. 

	What can I make? 
Possibly anything! You will be given a specific theme or prompt to get your team started. You can make hardware, a 3d rocket, a wooden laser-cut airplane, a mechanical robot, or even a mini bicycle. We provide participants resources as well 

	Who runs this? Is it supervised? 
Makerthon is independently organized by high school students’ part of the non-profit called Redmond STEM Center. We will have mentors available to help participants and a platform where you can ask them questions too!

	I have more questions…
Feel free to contact us through email: sanjay.nagesh@redmondstemcenter.org if you still have any lingering questions about anything!
